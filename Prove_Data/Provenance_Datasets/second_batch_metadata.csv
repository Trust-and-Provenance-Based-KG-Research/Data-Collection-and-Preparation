691000,"Discrete cosine transformation (DCT) is similar to discrete Fourier transform except DCT uses real cosine coefficients. Most of the information for DCT is contained in a handful of coefficients making it ideal for data compression, e.g. JPEG compression. DCT is a linear function with respect to spatial domain therefore, any image processing operation would yield similar results when performed in spatial or DCT domains.

This tutorial demonstrates image denoising by averaging images in real and DCT spaces, respectively.

1023000,"If the image histogram is confined only to a small region (low contrast images), histogram equalization can be used to stretch the histogram to include all ranges. But, this type of stretching may not result in ideal results and gives too bright and too dark regions in the image. This can be especially very bad for images with large intensity variations. 

Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
Regular histogram equalization uses global contrast of the image. This results in too bright and too dark regions as the histogram stretches and is not confined to specific region.

Adaptive histogram equalization divides the image into small tiles and within 
each tile the histogram is equalized. Tile size is typically 8x8. If the image contains noise, it gets amplified during this process. Therefore, 
contrast limiting is applied to limit the contrast below a specific limit. Bilinear interpolation is performed between tile borders. 

This tutorial demonstrates the use of histogram equalization and CLAHE in Python to enhance low contrast images.

551000,"BRISQUE calculates the no-reference image quality score for an image using the Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE). 

BRISQUE score is computed using a support vector regression (SVR) model trained on an image database with corresponding differential mean opinion score (DMOS) values. The database contains images with known distortion such as compression artifacts, blurring, and noise, and it contains pristine versions of the distorted images. The image to be scored must have at least one of the distortions for which the model was trained.

This tutorial explains the use of BRISQUE in Python.

3. Scaled rotation (translation + rotation + scaling)
4. Affine (translation + rotation + scaling + shearing)
5. Bilinear (non-linear transformation; does not preserve straight lines)

805000,"Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain is one of the primary tissue stains for histology. This is because H stain makes nuclei easily visible in blue against a pink background of cytoplasm (and other issue regions). This enables a pathologist to easily identify and evaluate the tissue; a highly manual process.

For automated image analysis these H&E stained images need to be normalized. This is because of the significant variation in image colors arising from both sample preparation and imaging conditions.  

This video explains the python code written to normalize H&E images and also to digitally separate images corresponding H and E stains, respectively.
